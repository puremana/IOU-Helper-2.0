# Deprecated

IOURPG has released an [offical unity client](https://iourpg.com/download.html) and as of 21/1/2020, annouced an IOU Multi-Launcher which should be released on 3/2/2020.

I made IOU Helper so people could more easily run the game by providing features such as running multiple accounts but when there is an official client who can fix bugs immediately and provide the same much needed features, there's no reason for me to continue to work on this project when the developers themselves are furfilling this role.

I will no longer but fixing any bugs, making any changes to the code or accepting pull requests. But feel free to open up the [app](https://github.com/puremana/IOU-Helper-2.0/tree/master/RELEASE/IOU%20Helper%202.0-win32-x64/resources/app) folder yourself if you wish to make changes and keep it updated.

Thank you all for supporting me through the development of these projects. I certainly wouldn't have done this without you.

## IOU Helper 2.0

IOU Helper 2.0 is a wrapper for the popular online game [IOURPG](https://iourpg.com).

2.0 is a rebuilt version of [IOU Helper](https://github.com/puremana/iou-helper) with [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), using HTML5, CSS and NodeJS.

Electron provides a faster, more responsive version of the original client however has higher CPU and RAM usage.
