IOU Helper 2.0 is a wrapper for the popular online game [IOURPG](https://iourpg.com).

2.0 is a rebuilt version of [IOU Helper](https://github.com/puremana/iou-helper) with [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), using HTML5, CSS and NodeJS.

Electron provides a faster, more responsive version of the original client however has higher CPU and RAM usage.
